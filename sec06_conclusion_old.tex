\section{Conclusion}
We have briefly presented three free-viewpoint systems for soccer games: the \textit{iview} system, an image-based method using 
plane sweeping and a billboard-based method.

The \textit{iview} system is a robust method using a multi-camera setup that performs 3D reconstruction exploiting a refinement 
of the view-dependent visual hull method.

The image-based method presented interpolates real camera images using a plane sweeping approach.
High quality images using wide baseline setup are obtained and typical artifacts are removed.

The billboard-based method is simpler than full 3D reconstruction and requires less computation.
However, this method produces lower quality images and some visual artifacts can be present.
