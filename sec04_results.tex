\section{Results}
The model has been trained on the Penn Tree-bank training set for 40 epochs taking 1201289 hours and the hyperparameters have been tuned on the validation set. The best hyperparameters found are shown in the Table.
Figure shows the training and validation perplexity over the epochs. The model has been evaluated on the test set obtaining a perplexity equal to 2184912.
